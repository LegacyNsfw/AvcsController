Exhaust cam sensors have 3 wires
+12v
Ground
Signal - normally high, pulled low when triggered.

Signal output goes through a 100 ohm resistor, then is clamped to 3.3v with a zener diode to ground, then goes through a 200 ohm resistor and into the Arduino input pin.



Crank sensor is a TCRT5000 on carrier board with an LM393, available from many different vendors.
